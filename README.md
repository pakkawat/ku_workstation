# Software Installation and Management Automation System for Virtual Laboratory on Cloud 

  This independent research aimed to solve the problem for the Department of Computer Science due to the different softwares used for learning each subject. Therefore, the developer has made a decision to solve the problem by utilizing Chef program to automatically install and manage software on Amazon EC2 Virtual Machines. Chef manages these machines through a command line issued from Chef Workstation. 
  
  We developed a Web Application to facilitate users to issue Chef commands more easily. A module called KnifeCommand was developed to translate user inputs in web forms into Chef commands. The system creates an Amazon EC2 Virtual Machine for each user and allows the user to login easily to the remote desktop using Guacamole. Each user can install and manage his own software through the system. Softwares for a subject will be installed on the virtual machine of every student registered for that subject. Since installing software can take a long time, the developer created a Job system to manage these tasks in the background and to show any errors that may occur. The system also calculates expenditure for each student using the work time of virtual machine, specification of virtual machine, size of storage, and data transfer from the virtual machine.
